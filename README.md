# Pitch Battles

## a pitch-naming web application game

### About

This application was built by Kevin Simpson using React.js, CSS, and the (Time Fantasy assets pack courtesy of
Jason Perry)[http://www.timefantasy.net/]. All assets are animated frame-by-frame in CSS with animation state controlled in React.

Pitch Battles current has two game modes: treble clef and bass clef. Future extensions will include alto clef and instrument specific pitch collections so that band and orchestra students can tailor the game to specifically test the pitches they need to know for their instrument.

While the application is fully-responsive, issues with keyframes on phones and a lack of proper vendor prefix support means that animations become a bit buggy on some iOS and Android devices. Future iterations of Pitch Battles would move to React Native to correct these issues.
